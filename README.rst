Code style:

* In general follow the Python PEP-8_ coding style, except line length can go up to 120 chars.
* Strings that have meaning for humans use double quotes (``"``), otherwise single quotes (``'``). When in doubt, don't
  worry about it.
* Code should be compatible with both Python 2 and 3, preferably without version-specific conditionals.

Run the test suite using ``python setup.py test``.
